Simple urlopener to replace my old Python version.

Allows you to specificy specific programs for certain domains and file extensions, for example I open video links (mp4, web, streamable ...) in mpv, while I open images (jpg, png ...) in feh.

If there is nothing after domain.tld there will be no check for forced domains. Questionable decision maybe, if you need that, it is easy to change.
